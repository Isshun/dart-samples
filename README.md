# Dart samples and tests 

Unfortunately Google's new [Dart programming language](http://www.dartlang.org/) is still hosted on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/dart/) making it a PITA to browse and introspect online.

It's also buried deep inside a 320MB SVN repository which is not ideal for quick offline browsing on the go.

This repository contains only the tests, samples (and frog compiler since its written in Dart :) and anything else I find that may help others familiarize themselves with Dart.

Having it in a GitHub repo means you can take advantage of GitHub's excellent browsing/navigation features whilst making it easily to clone for offline viewing.
